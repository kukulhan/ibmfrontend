# ![kukulhan](/resources/images/presentation.png?raw=true)

Install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli --unsafe-perm

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir frontibm
    npm install



### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start

Or you can use the polymer server just following the next command

    polymer start
